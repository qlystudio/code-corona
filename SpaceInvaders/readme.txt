I have just completed a series of videos I made to use in my Y13 class.  The main reason I made them was to demonstrate how to use classes within Corona.  When I made them I did not intent on sharing them with the community (not confident I have done everything correctly) so they are rather specific to my situation, but I have since decided the community has been so helpful to me that I should do some thing to give back...   I make no promises that everything is correct, but I think it is a fair attempt and my students have do far found them useful...

 

They have already watched most of the videos and have gone on to do things within the game that I would have never have thought of (and found mistakes within my code),  I learn more from them then they do from me....

Hope that someone might find these useful at sometime...
