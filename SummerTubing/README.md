*Summer Tubing* is a sports game where you sit in a pumped up car tire
and raft down a wild water river. Experience a sunny afternoon drifting
down the stream or race against others.

## Controls

Your feet and bum in the water for keeping the direction leaves only
your hands for paddling. Slide down the sides of the screen to move your
arms and paddle.

## Level design

Levels, displayed in portrait format, are a river with little obstacles
like rocks, bridges, and whirls or larger obstacles like a weer or
section of white water.
The player is dragged by the water depending on the section of the river
and might have to slowly drift or paddle all through a quiet section.
Turns in the river are hinted but virtually the river is a straight.
