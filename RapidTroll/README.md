#RAPID-TROLL


RT is a game inspired by the well-known classic Rapid Roll, designed for mobile devices (Android and iOS). It supports all resolutions and has facebook integration, so you are able to share your score in your profile. By the way, it was developed in 30 hours by only one person (me). I hope you can learn and enjoy this small but funny project.

##Test Apk	

If you only want to test the app, install on your Android phone:  [Rapid Roll apk](apk_exec/Rapid Roll.apk)


##Getting started with Corona Simulator

2) Execute simulator and open [Main.lua](main.lua)

	PD: Game uses accelerometer so you can't test all features in simulator.

3) Generate .apk with parameters:
